\textbf{Current working model:} 
\begin{align*}
grade &= \frac{-time}{efficiency} + knowledge*time + reward * Pr[reward]\\
&= -at + bt + AP[A], 0<a<1 b>1
\end{align*}

\section{Experiment 3}
Parameters that we could tweak:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time deadline
\item Requirement to LaTeX (have a dropbox)
\item Low self esteem / perception of being a weak player
\item Number of people rewarded
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Time deadline}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Require solutions to be due the day of (e.g. Tuesday or Thursday, any later and people will procrastinate and never get to it)
\item Turn in solutions right before the midterm (this is bad because it incentivizes cramming, but good because it helps reviewing)
\item Decrease score as time goes on (incentivizes turning things in early, but allows for turning things in late)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Number of people rewarded}
Tell students "You get rewarded if you're good enough"\\
Arbitrary number of students awarded each week based on reader rubric of what is "good enough"

\subsection{LaTeX}
Have a dropbox to turn in binder paper versions?

\subsection{Low Self Esteem}
Ego booster problems (WarmUp every time), gradient of extra credit (e.g. 1 point for easy problem, 2 points for hard problem)
\subsubsection{Bins}
Having a bin for every grade group (e.g. rank 1-50, 51-100, etc.) and picking top two from each bin (so lower bins are still incentivized to try!\\

Need to maintain privacy of grades: people selected, don't post which bin they're in\\

\subsection{Discussion Parties}
Have a Discussion Party Tuesday afternoon before homework is assigned

\section{Comparison of Correct Solutions}
--Length isn't a factor, maybe moderate correlation
--Maybe see how many of the bids are actually correct? Sometimes only one person is rewarded because the other bids aren't wholly correct
